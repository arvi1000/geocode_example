## Have a list of address for which you need state house and senate legislative districts?

This is an example R script for doing that using the geocod.io API

* You can download R (and RStudio, a desktop app that makes working with R easier) at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/
* You can get an geocod.io API key at https://www.geocod.io/
* The free account gives you 2500 lookups per day, and geocoding an address and mapping to leg. district counts as 2 calls, so you can do about 1250 addresses per day for free
